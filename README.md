# Floating Action Button for Xamarin.Forms

 - - - -

## I'm not actively supporting this library right now. 

It needs a fair amount for work for updating and I haven't had the time to do so as of late.

**This library requires AppCompat v21+**

A Xamarin.Forms wrapper for basic functionality of https://github.com/jamesmontemagno/FloatingActionButton-for-Xamarin.Android

And a Xamarin.Forms wrapper for a custom button on iOS

### Description

Floating action button for Xamarin.Forms.

```csharp
var layout = new RelativeLayout();
            
var normalFab = new FAB.Forms.FloatingActionButton();
normalFab.Source = "ic_add_white_24dp.png";
normalFab.Size = FabSize.Normal;

layout.Children.Add(
    normalFab,
    xConstraint: Constraint.RelativeToParent((parent) =>  { return (parent.Width - normalFab.Width) - 16; }),
    yConstraint: Constraint.RelativeToParent((parent) =>  { return (parent.Height - normalFab.Height) - 16; })
);

normalFab.SizeChanged += (sender, args) => { layout.ForceLayout(); };
```

Check the sample project to see additional examples.

### TODO Items

* Hide/Show FAB based on scroll of ScrollView, ListView or TableView
* Floating Action Menu
